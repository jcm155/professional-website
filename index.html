          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Joshua Mateer, and I am a student at
            the University of Pittsburgh! I'm pursuing a double major
            in Computer Science and Digital Narratives & Interactive Design.
            I've always loved programming, as I first started making basic games
            in JavaScript in 6th grade. Now, I know more than 8 programming languages,
            including Java, C#, JavaScript, and Rust, and I have also worked
            on a variety of professional products. Some of these projects
            include managing the back-end of my club's tech department
            and working with Robomatter Inc. to develop an app for
            VEX robotics. I'm hardworking and determined,
            ready to jump in wherever I'm needed. I always love to
            learn more and further develop my skills.
            If you're interested in learning more, you can find my
            resume here, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row content">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>
              I've worked on some pretty cool projects so far:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Designed a game to teach students about safe drinking practices: <a href="https://github.com/essebruce/Drink-Dash">Link</a></li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Learned Javascript and Unity to help develop a series of games for Valentine's Day: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/mad-cupid-games">Link</a></li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Created assets and a physics system from scratch for a new indie game: <a href="https://github.com/arb204/CS_1666_Platformer">Link</a></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p>
              I'm always interested in doing more projects, so reach out if you're interested!
              I enjoy working on a variety of projects, usually trying to emulate something else I've seen.
              If I see something and wonder, "can I make that but better", I try to give it a shot.
              I enjoy spending time with friends and doing events in my club, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rufatpitt/">RUF</a>. It's a fun community to hang out and discuss Christianity with anyone.

          <p class="blog-details">
            Here at Foray Games, we've realized something: Games are pretty
            awesome. We mean it! 
            <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/053115/how-video-game-industry-changing.asp">More and more people are turning to games</a>
            in these times, which we think is really great. Unfortunately, that 
            also means that people aren't going out as much, aren't taking as many risks, 
            which leads to people missing out on some really important key events.
            <a href="https://theconversation.com/teens-have-less-face-time-with-their-friends-and-are-lonelier-than-ever-113240">The drop in social aptitude</a> 
            and rise in loneliness, is linked to the rise of smartphones and social media 
            being easily accessed by students and young people. How can we combat this
            'lonelieness epidemic?' We here at Foray Games, we believe the answer is... 
            more games!
          </p>
          <img src="?https://www.clearvuehealth.com/images/social-media-depression.003.jpg" alt="social media makes depression worse">
          <p class="blog-details">
            "But Foray," I hear you saying. "You just said that games were causing people 
            to become isolated. Why would your games be any different?"
            Well, I'm so glad you asked. Here at Foray Games, we want people to overcome their loneliness, 
            get outside, and meet more friends. So we are trying hard
            to create games that every one can enjoy while also focuding on multiplayer experiences, 
            such as our signature build-your-own escape rooms or our upcoming 
            online escape rooms, inspired by the wildly popular Jackbox games. We want to get people 
            together by pushing people to look at each other and talk,
            rather than just talk through voice chat or something similar. Puzzles require sharing 
            information and discussing strategies, so this helps you to 
            meet friends and help young people to grow their personal social skills.

            Games, especially tabletop games like 7 Wonders (shown above) have been proven to bring 
            people together and help with depression and loneliness. Here at Foray Games, we want to incorporate 
            aspects of these games into fun, unique experiences which anyone can enjoy. We're hard at work analyzing 
            why different games make people so happy and what we can do to help with the rampant loneliness that is going around.

            Picture this: you're a young professional looking for a 
            way to spend your free time. The other games you've tried 
            seem too easy, or don't offer enough exploration to suit 
            your interests. You need a game that stimulates your brain 
            without making you want to break a controller. Also, you 
            want to get your friends involved, but most companies 
            don’t have many good options for playing games with 
            friends: it’s mostly either online battle-royale type 
            games or solo-focused story games. Why can’t it be both?
          </p>
          <img src ="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fpatch-v-1-6---fortnite-battle-royale%2FFortnite_BR_Key-Art_w-Logo_ENG-1920x1080-3e2ce1453476b725fa59e7aeb6ecb90e4b75a0df.jpg" alt="Fortnite Battle Royale">
          <p class="blog-details">
            At Foray Studios, we know that games are always more fun 
            when you play with a group of friends. That’s why we’re 
            hard at work revolutionizing the escape room genre of games. 
            Our latest release, Jewel Heist, is the world’s first fully 
            portable, replayable escape room. Small enough to fit in a 
            backpack, Jewel Heist allows players to turn any room into an 
            escape room game, and with 25 unique puzzles to solve with a 
            variety of difficulties, you’re sure to not run out of things 
            to do anytime soon. It uses the infinite arrangements of the 
            pentomino style of puzzles (think Tetris but with five 
            squares instead of four) to create puzzles with a similar 
            premise but never the same result. It can be played with any 
            number of players with multiple paths and ways to find the 
            solution to each and every puzzle.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-details">
            If you’re more into computer games, then Foray has got you 
            covered in that aspect as well. Our upcoming game, Gravitas, 
            promises a vast open world, multiple paths, exploration-based 
            platforming and combat, and multiple playable characters. If 
            you’re into any of these things, make sure to follow

          <p class="blog-details">
            Doing the Social Conversation Check made me realize 
            how many different resources are available for people 
            interesting in pursuing a career in game design, with 
            many people posting opportunities for jobs, ideas, 
            artwork commissions, commentaries on different mechanics 
            or character designs, or just thoughts on companies in general.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-details">
            One thing I learned from this exercise was what each social 
            media platform thinks of game design. Facebook primarily 
            treats game design as an opportunity to advertise your own 
            work. Designers like
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DefyRealityEntertainment/">Defy Reality Entertainment</a> 
            mainly use Facebook to advertise their Youtube channel and 
            share game design progress updates. LinkedIn, like most things 
            on LinkedIn, is mainly for finding careers in game design. 
            Unlike a lot of platforms, LinkedIn views game design as an 
            actual field and encourages developers to join projects 
            or larger corporations. Instagram is probably the 
            least interesting social media platform to investigate game 
            design. Since the site is mainly limited to pictures, 
            most people tend to engage the topic of game design by 
            posting pictures of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ2LfYPpHrn/">art assets</a> 
            or concept art, with the occasional <a>shameless plug for a new indie game.</a> (nothing wrong with that :P). 
            I personally really hate TikTok, but decided to see what 
            this platform had to offer in terms of game design. 
            Unlike nearly every other platform I looked at, this platform wasn’t really for sharing your 
            own games or assets, but sharing opinions on 
            the game industry, such as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@elderberrybat/video/6939252163684093189?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en">this video.</a> 
            One of the main appeals of TikTok is that you don’t have 
            to be an expert in your field in order to become popular, 
            which is very clear here. Most of the videos I watched 
            are people with no experience in designing talking about 
            why different aspects of game design are horrible. Maybe 
            it’s better to leave discussions like this to people who 
            know what they’re talking about. Speaking of people that 
            usually don’t know what they’re talking about, I looked 
            at Twitter next. A lot of people had your typical 
            “popular game bad" or “unpopular game good" posts, 
            but I found <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeBithell/status/1492581064312823818">this very interesting post</a> exploring 
            the concept of accessibility in video games. This is a topic 
            which is often hard to do correctly but is becoming a 
            thing which more and more developers are striving for. 
            A very interesting read which I would highly recommend 
            if you have the time. Finally, there’s Youtube, 
            which I personally thought had the most helpful resources 
            for designers. Channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys">Brackeys</a> 
            have incredible tutorials on all aspects of game engines 
            to check out, and channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DesignDoc">Design Doc</a> have 
            really great insights into what makes games fun to play, 
            fight, and explore.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-details">
            Overall, I learned a lot from this experience and hope to 
            put some of the practices, especially some of the tutorials 
            from Youtube on the technical skills required, as well as 
            some overall design tips. One design strategy in particular 
            I would love to implement more into my games and 
            interactive experiences is the concept of accessibility, 
            ensuring that people can enjoy my game regardless of 
            colorblindness, physical disabilities, or mental 
            disabilities. This often involves having to create a 
            sophisticated texturing and sound system to support a 
            wide range of experiences, but overall this is something 
            worth doing to accommodate anyone who wants to play my 
            games.

            Hello, everyone!

            I'm a game designer working with the goal of creatung unique experiences that bring people together
            and force them to think outside the box. I've been working with games for nearly nine years now and
            love not only playing games like <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/metroid-dread-switch/">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com/">Hollow Knight</a>,
            but analyzing them as well, trying to pick apart every piece of their design.

            The brand I'm trying to put out is someone who is a passionate and talented game designer.

          <p class="blog-details">
            My interest and hobbies are playing, examining, and designing games. Each aspect contributes to my brand
            by helping me to understand what people like and howe I can design products that appeal to a larger audience.
            The kind of strategies I would use is getting people to play my games, going on social media and writing influencers
            in order to get them to play my game. I would also create demos and post them so that people could provide feedback on my games.

            Technology is pretty cool! It allows us to do so many cool things, from surfing the web to watching shows
            to calling friends without them being there. But has technology permeated our lives too much? What if we took

            One of the benefits of electronic media is that it's a lot easier to do things,
            since everything is right at your fingertips. This means that we have access to do anything at any time, 
            and we don't have to spend time tarveling to a different location or gathering supplies. It allows for instant communication
            and knowledge gathering, as well as being able to combine results from people that are physically distant from one another. However, one of the major drawbacks is that
            it often leads to people becoming distracted instead of being productive. Too many times, I've found myself getting dragged into
            a rabbit-hole on Youtube or Reddit when I should be working on a piece of work that's due soon.

            Companies could use both the benefits and drawbacks of electronic media to reach out to their consumer base and
            connect with them more easily. This would allow them to form relationships with people
            that aren't even in the same country. They could also use the drawback of distractibility through things like pop-up ads
            to grab their customer's attention and pull them away from whatever they were working on.
